# Clinic Management System

A C programming project for managing patient records, appointments, and reservations in a clinic setting utilizing modular programming, input validation, and error handling concepts.

## Features

## Implementation

- Modular design with multiple source/header files for organization
- Input validation and error handling for robustness
- Switch cases for user choices and reliability
- Consistent naming and formatting for readability
- Data structures and algorithms for efficient data management

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile `main.c`, `admin.c`, and `user.c`.
3. Execute the compiled binary.
   - On Linux: `./clinic`
   - On Windows: `clinic.exe`
4. Follow the prompts.

## I welcome any feedback on how I may improve the code
